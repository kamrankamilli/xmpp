# If mcabber is built with modules support, you can specify the path

# value should be appropriate.

# Internal hooks
# You can ask mcabber to execute an internal command when a special event

# 'hook-post-connect' is executed when mcabber has connected to the server
# and the roster has been received.

# FIFO
# mcabber can create a FIFO named pipe and listen to this pipe for commands.
# Don't forget to load the FIFO module if you plan to use this feature!
# Default: disabled.
# Set 'fifo_hide_commands' to 1 if you don't want to see the FIFO commands
# in the log window (they will still be written to the tracelog file).
# When FIFO  is configured, you can turn it off and on in real time with
# the 'fifo_ignore' option (default: 0).  When set to 1, the FIFO input is
# still read but it is discarded.

#  lvl 3: debug logging (XML, etc.)
#  lvl 4: noisy debug logging (Loudmouth parser...)
